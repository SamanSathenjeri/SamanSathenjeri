- 👀 Check out my nano implementation of the Deepseek-V3 model
  - 🧑‍🔬 Comes with Mixture of Experts (MoE), Multiheaded Latent Attention (MLA), and Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE)
  - 📖 Trained on the FineWebEdu dataset

- 🚨 Check out my implementation of a nano-BERT model with Apple's MLX framework
  - 🍎 Usage of Apple's open-source machine learning framework developed for Apple silicon
  - 🔱 Comes with Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Multi-headed Attention
  - 🎯 Finetuned to summarize long texts (answer SQuAD-style questions) --> possibly use it with RAG

- 🧑‍🍳 Projects that are cooking:
  - 💻 [Collaborative Code Editor](https://github.com/SamanSathenjeri/codeEditor) - Uses Websockets and Amazon S3 to create a collaborative experience for pair (or group) coding
  - ✍️ Smart Document System/Assistant - Taking inspiration from Microsoft's Copilot and Semantic Indexing to create a document system that can use 
  - 📈 Calibration and Simulation of Rough Volatility Models - Optimized Monte Carlo simulations of fractional Brownian volatility, using the Rough Bergomi model, on a multi-node HPC cluster
